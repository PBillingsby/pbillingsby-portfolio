          My name is Phil. I am a Full-Stack Developer located in Clark County,
          Nevada. Originally from Australia I relocated to USA in 2017 and found
          my passion for Software Development.

          After dabbling with Python and teaching myself core computer
          fundamental concepts I enrolled in Flatiron School's Software
          Engineering course. I then discovered that I thoroughly enjoy
          automating anything I possibly can and get immense joy from problem
          solving and creating web applications from scratch.
        </p>

          I am a huge fan of the open source community and developers striving
          to expand the industry to make innovative, useful products to better
          the world of tech.
